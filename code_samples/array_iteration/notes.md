## Explanation of Key Steps

### Data Section:
The .data section initializes an array of integers, its length, a variable to hold the sum, and a message to display before the result. The result buffer is reserved for later use.

### Text Section:
The .text section contains the executable code. The program starts executing from the _start label.
Initialization:
```
    mov ecx, [array_len]: Load the length of the array into ecx.
    xor ebx, ebx: Clear ebx which accumulates the sum.
    xor esi, esi: Initialize the index register esi to 0.
```

### Iteration Loop:
`cmp esi, ecx`: Compare the current index against the length of the array.

`jge done`: If the index is greater than or equal to the length, jump to done.

`mov al, [array + esi]`: Load the current element of the array into the al register.

`add ebx, eax`: Add the current element to the sum in ebx.

`inc esi`: Increment the index to process the next element.

`jmp iterate`: Repeat the iteration.

### Sum Storage:
Store the sum in sum by moving the lower byte of ebx into it.

### Printing the Result:
Use the Linux syscall sys_write to print the message and the computed sum. The sum is converted to ASCII for printing.


### Exit:
The program ends with a call to the sys_exit syscall to exit cleanly.

### Compilation Instructions
To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

Save the program to a file, for example, sum_array.asm.
Assemble the program with YASM:
bash
```
yasm -f elf32 -o sum_array.o sum_array.asm
```
