These are the GDB debug commands demonstrated in the video:


- the `nop` instruction does nothing, but it provides a useful point to stop the program, allowing for inspection.

- launch the program into the gdb debugger: `$ gdb main`

- enter a break point for main on line 137: `$ b main.asm:137`

- list the break points: `$ info b`

- run the program after the break point(s) are entered: `$ run`

- print out the contents of the registers: `$ info registers` or `$ info r`

- to continue program execution when at a break point: `$ continue` or `$ c` 

- to quit the debugging process: `$ quit` or `$ q`

- entering a break point in the gdb config file: `b main.asm:137`

- here is a simple sample of gdb-commands.txt (name is optional but must conform to name in makefile's debug target):

```
	b main.asm:137
	b main.asm:147
	b main.asm:172
	info break
	run
```
