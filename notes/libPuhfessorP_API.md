This document describes some of the functions available inside the *libPuhfessorP* library.

## Notes

This section contains noteworthy concerns and information.

### Stack Alignment

If your program mysteriously crashes with ```segmentation fault``` when calling functions in this library, it may be that your stack is not properly aligned. Some functions in libPuhfessorP rely on other functions inside the C standard library, which may in turn expect that the stack is aligned to 16 bytes before a ```call``` instruction.

Since each ```push``` or ```pop``` instruction alters the stack pointer by 8 bytes, one thing you can try is adding an extra pair of ```push```/```pop``` in the prologue and epilogue areas of your function before a ```call``` is made.

### Special Values

This section describes some special values to be aware of when working with this library.

#### Special 64-bit Signed Integer Values

When calling on a function that returns a signed 64-bit integer, be aware that the value ```0x8000000000000000``` represents an invalid integer. Normally, this value essentially represents the "most negative integer" that a 64-bit signed integer can represent, but it is being used to represent an invalid integer here in this library.

It's a good idea to check the value of integers you receive from any functions against this special value, as a way to check whether or not you received a valid integer.

|Base   |Value                     |
|-------|-------------------------:|
|Hex    |0x8000000000000000        |
|Decimal|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808|
|Binary|10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000|

## Input Functions

### libPuhfessorP_inputLine

The ```libPuhfessorP_inputLine``` function will read a line of input from the console (whatever characters the user submits until they hit enter).

Arguments:

1. Pointer to your input buffer
2. Size of your input buffer

### libPuhfessorP_inputSignedInteger64

The ```libPuhfessorP_inputSignedInteger64``` function will read a signed 64-bit integer from the console.

Arguments: none

Returns:

* If the user entered a valid integer: A 64-bit signed integer

* Otherwise: The special value for an invalid integer (explained above)

### libPuhfessorP_inputFloat64

The ```libPuhfessorP_inputFloat64``` function will read a 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number from the console.

Arguments: none

Returns: A 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number

## Output Functions

### libPuhfessorP_printSignedInteger64

The ```libPuhfessorP_printSignedInteger64``` function will print a signed 64-bit integer to the console.

Internally, this function first calls on ```libPuhfessorP_signedInteger64ToString``` to convert your integer to a string, then prints it to the terminal. Therefore, it's a good idea to check the bevahior of ```libPuhfessorP_signedInteger64ToString``` as well.

Arguments:

1. The integer you wish to print

### libPuhfessorP_printFloat64

The ```libPuhfessorP_printFloat64``` function will print a 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number to the console.

Arguments:

1. The 64-bit float you wish to print

## Parsing and Conversion Functions

### libPuhfessorP_lTrim, libPuhfessorP_rTrim, and libPuhfessorP_trim

The functions ```libPuhfessorP_lTrim```, ```libPuhfessorP_rTrim```, and ```libPuhfessorP_trim``` will trim a string from the left side, right side, and both sides.

Arguments:

1. A pointer to the string to be trimmed

### libPuhfessorP_parseSignedInteger64

The ```libPuhfessorP_parseSignedInteger64``` function converts a string to a signed 64-bit integer.

Arguments:

1. A pointer to the string's first character

Returns:

* If the string contained a valid integer: A 64-bit signed integer

* Otherwise: The special value for an invalid integer (explained above)

### libPuhfessorP_parseFloat64

The ```libPuhfessorP_parseFloat64``` function converts a string to a 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number.

Arguments:

1. A pointer to the string's first character

Returns: A 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number if the string was valid, or just a ```0``` if the string was invalid.

### libPuhfessorP_signedInteger64ToString

The ```libPuhfessorP_signedInteger64ToString``` function will convert a signed 64-bit integer to a string.

Note that if you send it the special value for an invalid integer (explained above), it will simply render the letter ```X```

Arguments:

1. The integer you wish to convert
2. The address of a character buffer where the string can be written

### libPuhfessorP_float64ToString

The ```libPuhfessorP_float64ToString``` function will convert a 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number to a string.

Arguments:

1. The 64-bit float you wish to convert
2. The address of a character buffer where the string can be written

## Debugging Functions

### libPuhfessorP_printRegisters

The function ```libPuhfessorP_printRegisters``` will dump the contents of (most) registers to the console.
